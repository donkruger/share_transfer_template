A risk score in this range represents investors that are comfortable suffering a loss of up to -15% in pursuit of positive returns of up to +25% over a six-month period. This investor is often referred to as an aggressive investor.

Investment strategies that satisfy this group are focused on capital appreciation as a primary investment objective, rather than income preservation. As such aggressive portfolios are biased towards investing in assets with a higher degree of uncertainty of returns in the pursuit of greater returns. This approach is suitable for those investors that are very comfortable with enduring large short-term losses of their capital in pursuit of the desired long terms returns. Typically, these are young investors with a very long time horizons and higher risk scores. However, aggressive portfolios also serve those that have not invested appropriately for their retirement and now have little option but to take substantially more investment risk.

This is achieved through asset allocation and then by identifying the best performing qualifying assets capable of delivering the return objectives of the investor with a 95% probability of staying within the investors comfort zone.

The Just One Risky Aggressive Bundle is a higher risk index-tracking offering consisting of 40% local equities, 40% international equities and 20% local property ETFs. For a local flavour, Simon has selected the CoreShares Equally Weighted Top 40 - an ETF that gives you 2.5% exposure to the 40 biggest companies listed on the JSE. The equal weighting protects your portfolio from overexposure to the share price of individual companies. To protect your portfolio from local market risks like political instability, Simon has included the db X-tracker MSCI World Index ETF, fondly known to the Just One Lap team as the DBX World. This ETF invests in the biggest companies across 27 different countries, which means 40% of your portfolio is protected should something go wrong with local markets. Finally, the CoreShares Proptrax Ten invests in the 10 biggest property companies in South Africa. Because property ETFs are protected by bricks and mortar investments, this ETF brings a bit of stability to a high-speed portfolio.

A risk score in this range represents investors that are comfortable suffering a loss of up to -4% in pursuit of positive returns of up to +10% over a six-month period. This investor is often referred to as a capital preservation investor.

This group want to preserve their income. Investment strategies that qualify favour assets that offer certainty of return over the uncertainty of return. Therefore this is aimed at investors who would not only like to take on minimal risk but also gain exposure to fixed income and money market products. This is achieved through asset allocation and then by identifying the best performing qualifying assets capable of delivering the return objectives of the investor with a 95% probability of staying within the investors comfort zone. E.g. the average investor for this group is represented by a risk score of 30.

Have you recently felt like the dim outcast at social gatherings while the cool kids all scroll feverishly through their mobile crypto wallets sharing stories of people that got in early and have made a fortune?
Blockchain, miners, public ledgers, smart contracts, private keys, public keys, crypto wallets, cold storage, encrypted USB’s. SHOO.
Crypto’s are a complicated affair and while Bitcoin has breached the $14,000 mark if this bubble pops, as many learned people believe it will, we could see a massive correction that could wipe out the holdings of many people.
With the extraordinary volatility of crypto’s, any investment in them is dangerous at best.
But we think that there’s a safer way to ride this crypto train. There is a saying in the start-up world that “you can mine for gold or you can sell shovels”. During the California Gold Rush of the early 1850’s, while mining gold was considered the more exciting and glamorous path, some of the most successful business people of the times made their fortunes selling supplies like shovels, tents, wheelbarrows and pickaxes to the miners.
The massive Levi Strauss & Co, manufacturers of the Levi jeans you wear today, was born at this time when the family decided to open a West Coast branch of the family business in San Francisco, the commercial hub of the Gold Rush.
So rather than try and plot the rollercoaster ride of the Cryptocurrencies themselves, we’ve constructed a Crypto bundle containing various companies with associations with the Crypto industry which we believe will offer you a considerably safer ride on the Crypto train.

To find those strong businesses, this strategy goes back as far as a decade into a company's history, so only stocks with consistent long-term track records can pass this methodology. The Buffett strategy buys stocks with an extremely long-term horizon.
Validea used the investment strategy outlined in the book Buffettology written about Warren Buffett to create the Patient Investor/Warren Buffett portfolio.

Every great sauce requires patience, technique, quality ingredients and a little bit of flare. But, what’s a sauce without a kitchen and a chef? EasyEquities and the Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA) serve as the ideal kitchen, while chefs Igor and Tshepo present the perfect recipe of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). A Secret Sauce that is local at heart, with hints of African and international flavours.
The Secret Sauce Basket is perfectly suited for a TFSA, which allows investors to save money for a long investment horizon and take advantage of avoiding income tax, dividends tax or capital gains tax on the returns from the investments in the account. The basket objectives take advantage of the favourable terms of the TFSA by focusing on long-term capital growth, dividends and income.
Diversification is the main feature of the Secret Sauce Basket, as the ETFs selected give exposure to local, African and international companies, together with South African government bonds. Each EFT is a critical and different ingredient needed to create the Secret Sauce.
The Secret Sauce Basket is ideal for investors looking to utilise their TFSA by consistently contributing and holding their investment for a period of six years and longer.

Growing up my parents wanted the best for my sisters and I, and I often saw in my Dad’s eyes how it pained him when he had to say no to certain things or how my mom would say “wait until the end of the month”. They often spoke about how they wish they had the advantage of knowing about investments.
One of the most important callings in one’s life is parenting, and for most parents nothing is more important than investing in their children’s life, wellbeing and future.
The “Leave a legacy” basket has been created as a gift from parents to their children. It is a token of love and appreciation not only to make sure that they’re well taken care of, but that they have access to opportunities and are given an advantage at life. It is an opportunity to secure your child’s education, their first car, first property or even that start up capital for their innovative business idea.
Children are priceless, so let us take care of the numbers for you with the balanced growth Legacy TFSA basket brought to you by EasyEquities and Nicolette Mashile, compiled by fund manager, TC van der Walt from Emperor Asset Management.

For most people gaming is not just a hobby, but a passion and in most cases a lifestyle. We all try to do our best to support local and international gaming brands and organisations; however, sometimes these organisations make it difficult to support them because of their maladministration, over the top greedy practices or just making us move from one update to another update to another update and not really getting the chance to enjoy the game you just paid for in some cases over 1000 bucks!

You are probably wondering if there is a solution to this. Well yes, not the be all and end all of the solutions but possibly one of the best solutions for us to reduce our pain and suffering when it comes to some of our beloved companies. Now this solution I am about to tell you about is not only for the brands and organisations you are frustrated with but also those that make you smile and know you are getting your monies worth. Imagine for a second if we had a way of empowering our voices and impact by means of giving more money to our favourite company and getting direct answers without the standard PR rigmarole. Now before you say, you give enough, think for a second when you buy a game from a store that is as much you are going to do for that company until you buy there next game or product. Now I think if we had the ability to directly have a say in those companies, or at least voice them without being drowned out because we are just mere customers.
My Solution 
As with any product or service, I would love to communicate or voice my grievance or gratitude directly to some of the top dogs in those companies, and now with Easy Equities, the tools for this are here. I signed up to the Easy Equities investment platform and could not believe my eyes when I saw you could purchase and trade shares for Activision, Blizzard, AMD and the list goes on. Then I got the idea, after the quick signup process I got trading with the account and started depositing starting capital and bought AMD shares and Blizzards shares thereafter I waited to see if this investment would pay out and it did after my initial investment of $250 (R2,999), my portfolio in both AMD and Blizzard increased just under 50% to $440 (R 5278).
With that being said, imagine if you bought shares and had the opportunity to have a say on where the money should go and why you disagree with the practices of the company while making money back in the process. Well that is exactly why I believe we should all be buying shares in companies we love and improving them with constructive criticism. Oh and just to leave everyone with a nice motivating line, if more people bought shares than there would be no need for microtransactions or paid loot boxes.

To achieve this goal our investment philosophy is to own medium to long-term positions in quality large cap companies that can demonstrate both strong earnings growth and high investment quality over time.To identify these stocks we follow a strict and rigorous quantitative process that consists of 5 factors which are Value, Momentum, Quality, Earnings Revisions and Analyst Consensus. A company is automatically excluded from the portfolio if they have a history of pushing the moral and ethical boundaries. The same process is used continuously to identify possible risks in our portfolios. We remain sector neutral and rebalance our portfolios on a quarterly base to minimise trading cost, take advantage of new opportunities and/or exit high risk investments. Return expectations can be similar to the FTSE/JSE All share index with a very good probability of outperformance over the 3 to 5 year term.Risk DisclosureThese portfolios hold equity exposure and are indirectly or directly impacted by political and economic factors which may result in significant capital volatility over all periods.

Machabeng is invested in companies that represent superior intrinsic value, that are underpinned by strong fundamentals and that are backed by experienced management teams with solid track records. The firms are identified and selected using a disciplined investment process. This process is based on detailed bottom-up research conducted with a long-term view.US dollar-denominated assets make up 100% of the portfolio, which has a long-term strategic target to hold assets priced in hard currencies. Exposure to other major currencies – including the Euro, Swiss franc Chinese yuan, Japanese yen and British pound – is achieved through the operations of the underlying companies in geographies outside of the US.The exposure to equities is established through a concentrated portfolio of companies held over long investment periods, which means portfolio management costs are kept as low as possible. The primary goal of the portfolio is to produce high capital growth over the long term measured in US dollars.The Machabeng Portfolio invests in a portfolio of global equities. Exposure to growth-based, dollar-priced assets means that the portfolio does not comply with the investment limits governing retirement funds (Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act). There are no limits or constraints to the geographic allocation or currency allocation of the portfolio. The portfolio matches equity sector exposure based on global equity market sector exposures. The underlying assets are then chosen based on valuation, financial strength and equity class. Certain equities are excluded based on their environmental, social or governance issues. These shares are held over the longer term to realize their value.The portfolio is suited to investors who:seek long-term capital growth ahead of US dollar consumer price inflation and ahead of headline equity-market indices (specifically the S&P 500);can tolerate short-term portfolio volatility associated with an aggressive investment mandate;need global investment exposure; andhave an investment horizon of at least five years.EFFECTIVE ANNUAL COST (EAC)Transaction Costs 0,13Asset Management Charge 1,35Effective Annual Cost (%) 1,48Calculate your Risk Number HereFactsheet available Here",https://resources.easyequities.co.za/logos/EQU.ZA.SYGJP.png,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,5,Ready,"2,3,1,11,18,55",,south-african

Effectus
Global Growth and Innovation Fund (GIF Fund)
The GIF Fund
is a global, actively managed high growth fund. We focus on buying companies
that have a structural long term earnings growth outlook. Part of this process
involves understanding the key technologies, innovations and mega trends that
create long term structural tail winds.
Our preference is to look for companies that
are best in class with a sustainable technological advantage or innovation
edge. Typically, they have two main forms: 1) niche innovative disruptors that
operate in massive industries with high growth trajectories and long timelines
(healthcare and healthtech is an obvious example), and 2) innovative
aggregators: companies that harness convergent industries and technologies to
create powerful self-reinforcing platforms for growth and expansion. For
example, companies that incorporate big data, cybersecurity, networking, cloud
storage, SaaS and AI.

Environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) investing (also known as ""socially responsible
investing,"" ""impact investing,"" and ""sustainable
investing"") refers to investing that prioritizes the best environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) elements or results. ESG investing is often seen
as a means of investing ""sustainably,"" that is, with the environment
and human well-being, and the economy, in mind. It is based on the rising
belief that environmental and social variables are becoming increasingly important
with regards to an organization's financial success.
Environmental (E)
Climate change is possibly the
most serious challenge confronting humanity, and thus the most essential ESG
aspects to consider; this is due to the likely impact of climate change on
every part of our lives, as well as the legislative and societal reforms that
will be required to battle it. It's critical to understand how a company
contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint, resource consumption,
waste practices, and energy needs. Organizations will either be able to thrive
or struggle when international governments make the essential policy
adjustments if they plan for and react to these changes.
Social (S) 
The treatment of a company's
workers is an important factor to consider when evaluating its ESG performance.
A corporation that treats its people well and with respect is expected to
provide equal and fair working conditions, wages, and rights. Gender, race, or
religious convictions should not be used to discriminate against employees.
Mistreatment of employees can have a variety of implications, ranging from
challenges in keeping talented workers to strike activities. Similarly, protecting
the safety of employees is a critical responsibility as poor health and safety
may result in criminal charges, fines, or regulatory penalties, which impact
share performance
Governance (G)
The considerations in this
section of the ESG assessment all have to do with how a company is run, how it
makes decisions, the board of directors is formed, functions, compensation, manages
risks, and how it handles with shareholder rights.
Why ESG
Although ESG seems like a new
term, the practice of ESG investing began in the 1960s. ESG investing evolved
from socially responsible investing (SRI), which excluded stocks or entire
industries from investments related to business operations such as tobacco,
guns, or goods from conflicted regions.
According to certain studies,
organizations with strong ESG policies have a lower cost of capital, less
volatility, and fewer cases of bribery, corruption, and fraud over time.
Companies with lower ESG scores, on the other hand, have a greater cost of
capital, more volatility owing to controversies and other incidents such as
labour strikes, and fraud, as well as accounting and other governance issues,
according to research.
Our Strategy for ESG Investing
Emperor uses four main building blocks, across
individual shares to construct our portfolios: Value, Quality, Stability, and
Momentum. Our asset management process is driven by algorithmic analysis of the
market data which blends together a portfolio of shares that exhibit value,
quality, stability and momentum characteristics. We then incorporate ESG
ratings in the portfolio, putting more weight to stocks with a high ESG score
as supplied by MSCI and removing or allocating less to stocks with a lower
score to keep the overall portfolio ESG score high. MSCI’s Final
Industry-adjusted Score for each company corresponds to a rating between best
(AAA) and worst (CCC), we aim to keep the portfolio at an average rating of AA.",https://resources.easyequities.co.za/logos/TFSA.GLODIV.png,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,5,Ready,"3,11,55",,south-african

""We are 19 years old. We made our first
investments when we were just 12 years old (7 years ago) on EasyEquities. We have
a passion for investing as it has changed our lives. We have made it our
mission to help change other people's lives too through education.
This passion for investing led us to
creating our twitter accounts (@YoungInvestor03 & @GenZInvestor4) where we
regularly tweet about what we have learnt on our investing journeys so far. We
have accumulated a following of +- 20 000 followers together on twitter
from just tweeting about what we love - Investing. 
On the 25th of February, this year we
released our first investing eBook - ""The Ultimate Beginners Guide to
Investing in the Stock Market."" We have also begun informing the youth
about the world of investing and encouraging them to start their journey.
This is just the
start. We plan on releasing more educational products in the future such as
eBooks and more education for the youth.""

While some or all of the above advantages may be true, it depends upon various other factors, including the design, construction, materials used and specifics of the suspension in question. However, the one clear, undeniable advantage of upside-down forks is that they offer a more rigid set-up overall, which has a better capability of handling extreme stress during hard steering, braking, and other strenuous conditions. Why is that so? To fully understand an inverted fork telescopic suspension’s advantages, we first need to know about the construction of a standard telescopic fork suspension. A telescopic fork suspension comprises an outer slider wider in diameter and is generally quite sturdy. The other part of the telescopic suspension is the stanchion which moves inside the slider. Within this set-up, you also have springs, dampers and oil seals which prevent the damping fluid from coming out of the assembly. While the spring compresses and expands to absorb and release the energy transferred to the suspension as the wheel passes over rough surfaces, the damper unit controls the spring’s compression and expansion rate. Therefore, modern telescopic forks, whether right side up or upside-down, utilise a similar spring and damper set-up. Hence, in terms of the operation of the spring and dampers, there is hardly any difference between the conventional telescopic forks and upside-down forks. There is, however, a big difference in the strength and rigidity of the two set-ups. A telescopic fork experiences the most amount of stress just below the bottom yoke, or what is also known as a triple clamp or fork bridge. When a motorcycle is subjected to heavy braking or cornering at high speeds, it’s this part of the bike, right under the triple clamp, subjected to the most stress. If the steering componentry is not rigid enough, it will make the steering and suspension bend and flex, which is not good for dynamic ability, steering feedback or rider confidence. In the traditional, right side up telescopic fork set-up, it is the less rigid stanchion that has to bear all the stress. In an upside-down fork set-up, the roles get reversed, and the slider, which has a wider diameter and is sturdier, gets to handle most of the stress. With the stiffer slider taking over that duty, the torsional stiffness of the suspension is increased, preventing flex, or bending. This leads to improved rigidity, enhancing stability and rider feedback, especially under extreme conditions where the mechanicals of the motorcycle are subjected to extremes. Also, while it’s not always the case, the sliders on an upside-down fork suspension are often longer than the ones on conventional forks. This increases the overlap of the slider and stanchion, resulting in an overall sturdier set-up. In a nutshell, in the case of upside-down forks, with the more rigid slider taking up the responsibility of absorbing the lion’s share of stress, the flex is reduced – improving handling and feel. The benefits offered by upside-down forks over their conventional counterparts are generally not very noticeable during street use. Even the conventional telescopic forks on motorcycles from reputable manufacturers are exceptionally well designed for the purpose they are meant for. It would be challenging for the riders to figure a difference between the two in everyday road conditions, or even while pushing the bike around moderately challenging situations, like while canyon carving. In extreme conditions, however, such as on a racetrack or in specialised applications such as a motocross bike, the advantages offered by inverted forks are more evident.",https://resources.easyequities.co.za/logos/EQU.ZA.UST500.png,0,0,0,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,5,Ready,"2,1,11,18,55",,south-african

It has gained substantial traction since its entry into markets due to its intriguing peer-review infrastructure. Updates to the Cardano system are made through peer-reviewed scientific research and voted upon by a global community of academic researchers and scholars. The Cardano community asserts ADA as a “3rd-generation” cryptocurrency. Cardano was developed to solve the 3 predominant issues of the former generations. Namely: scalability, interoperability and sustainability. 1st generation crypto assets transfer and store virtual money, but are hindered by scalability issues (transactions per second, network bandwidth and storage). The 2nd generation of crypto assets are underpinned by smart contracts but are similarly unable to address scalability obstacles. Cardano’s Ouroboro system solves scalability through proof-of-stake (PoS), rather than proof-of-work (PoW) set forth by the BTC protocol. PoS offers enhanced efficiency because it doesn’t allow all participants to mine new blocks, reducing global energy requirements. Instead, the PoS network elects’ specific nodes to mine the next blocks. ADA solves the issue of large bandwidth requirements by sub-dividing the ADA network into silos using a technique called recursive internetwork architecture (RINA). Moreover, ADA resolves the problem of storage requirements through pruning, compression and partitioning. Interoperability allows ADA to accommodate transactions between other cryptocurrencies. This essentially grants ADA the power to function as a crypto asset intermediary operating as the “internet of blockchains”. Stated differently, ADA is constituted by a blockchain protocol capable of interpreting other blockchains. Governments and banks have historically shied away from cryptocurrencies because they don’t adhere to customary financial regulations. Majority of cryptocurrencies lack the metadata necessary to determine transaction participants and the nature of such transactions. However, part of the crypto appeal is this very anonymity. The Cardano protocol, however, allows participants the discretion to attach metadata to transactions if they prefer to do so. Hence, accommodating the potential for institutional cooperation. Finally, ADA addresses the issue of sustainability through a treasury. The ADA treasury receives a micro-percentage of every transaction on the blockchain. The treasury itself is a special wallet not controlled by a central party. The treasury is built on a system which releases ADA to developers whom enhance the system’s protocol through the peer-review voting system. To receive compensation from the treasury, developers have to submit a proposal to the ADA community describing the updates to the system, and how much ADA they require for the development. Hence, the community votes on ideas for which the treasury must fund. Over time the treasury model keeps Cardano sustainable by providing a continuous stream of funding that can be used to bolster research and improve the system.",https://resources.easyequities.co.za/logos/EQU.ZA.UAMIRE.png,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Ready,"2,1,11,18,55",,south-african
