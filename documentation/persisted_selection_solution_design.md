# Persisted Selection Solution Design

## Problem Statement

### Current Issue
Users experience frustration when their instrument selections are inadvertently cleared during the search workflow. Specifically:

1. **Selection Loss on New Search**: When users perform a new search after selecting instruments from previous results, their selections are lost
2. **Clear Button Overreach**: The "Clear" button removes both search results AND selected instruments, which is overly aggressive
3. **Inconsistent State Management**: Selection state is managed reactively rather than persistently, leading to unexpected behavior
4. **Poor UX Flow**: Users must remember to complete their selection process in one search session, limiting exploration

### Business Impact
- **Reduced User Satisfaction**: Users lose work and must restart selection process
- **Inefficient Workflow**: Prevents users from building comprehensive instrument portfolios across multiple searches
- **Abandonment Risk**: Frustrating UX may lead to users abandoning the application
- **Support Burden**: Increased user complaints and support requests

    style H fill:#ff6b6b
```

### Current Implementation Issues

#### 1. Aggressive Clearing in `search_interface.py`
```python
def _clear_results(self):
    """Clear search results from session state."""
    if 'current_results' in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.current_results = []
    if 'selected_instruments' in st.session_state:  # ❌ PROBLEM: Clears selections
        st.session_state.selected_instruments = []
```

#### 2. Selection Logic in `result_display.py`
```python
# Current selection management is reactive and fragile
if selected:
    if result not in st.session_state.get('selected_instruments', []):
        if 'selected_instruments' not in st.session_state:
            st.session_state.selected_instruments = []
        st.session_state.selected_instruments.append(result)
```

#### 3. Utility Function Overreach in `utils.py`
```python
def clear_search_results():
    """Clear current search results and related state."""
    st.session_state.current_results = []
    st.session_state.selected_instruments = []  # ❌ PROBLEM: Clears selections
```

## Solution Design

### Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Distinguish between search results and user selections
2. **Persistent Selection State**: Maintain selections across multiple search sessions
3. **Explicit User Control**: Only clear selections when user explicitly requests it
4. **Defensive Programming**: Handle edge cases and state inconsistencies gracefully
5. **Enhanced UX**: Provide clear feedback about selection state and management options

### Proposed Architecture

#### 1. Enhanced Session State Structure
```python
# Enhanced session state organization
st.session_state = {
    # Search-related state (temporary)
    "current_results": [],           # Current search results (cleared on new search)
    "search_history": [],            # Search query history
    "last_search_query": "",         # Most recent search query
    
    # Selection-related state (persistent)
    "selected_instruments": [],      # User's instrument selections (PERSISTENT)
    "selection_metadata": {          # Enhanced selection tracking
        "total_selected": 0,
        "selection_timestamps": {},   # When each instrument was selected
        "selection_sources": {},      # Which search query led to each selection
        "last_modified": None
    },
    
    # User workflow state
    "selection_mode": "accumulate",  # "accumulate" | "replace" | "review"
    "show_selection_panel": True,    # Whether to show persistent selection panel
}
```

#### 2. Selection Management Service

Create a dedicated `SelectionManager` class to handle all selection-related operations:

```python
# app/services/selection_manager.py
class SelectionManager:
    """
    Centralized service for managing instrument selections with persistence,
    deduplication, and enhanced user control.
    """
    
    @staticmethod
    def add_instrument(instrument: Dict[str, Any], source_query: str = "") -> bool:
        """Add instrument to selections with metadata tracking."""
        
    @staticmethod
    def remove_instrument(instrument_key: str) -> bool:
        """Remove instrument from selections by unique key."""
        
    @staticmethod
    def clear_selections(confirm: bool = False) -> bool:
        """Clear all selections with confirmation requirement."""
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_selections() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get current selections with metadata."""
        
    @staticmethod
    def is_selected(instrument: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Check if instrument is already selected."""
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_selection_summary() -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get summary statistics about current selections."""
```

#### 3. Improved UI Components

##### Enhanced Search Interface
```python
# Modified search_interface.py
class SearchInterface:
    def _clear_results(self):
        """Clear ONLY search results, preserve selections."""
        if 'current_results' in st.session_state:
            st.session_state.current_results = []
        # ✅ DO NOT clear selected_instruments
        
    def render_clear_options(self):
        """Provide granular clearing options."""
        col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
        with col1:
            if st.button("Clear Results", help="Clear current search results only"):
                self._clear_results()
        with col2:
            if st.button("Clear Selections", 
                        help="Clear your selected instruments", 
                        type="secondary"):
                self._show_clear_selections_dialog()
```

##### Persistent Selection Panel
```python
# New component: app/components/selection_panel.py
class SelectionPanel:
    """
    Persistent panel showing user's selected instruments across all searches.
    Always visible, provides selection management capabilities.
    """
    
    def render_persistent_panel(self):
        """Render always-visible selection panel in sidebar or main area."""
        
    def render_selection_item(self, instrument: Dict, index: int):
        """Render individual selected instrument with remove option."""
        
    def render_selection_actions(self):
        """Render bulk actions for selections (clear all, export, etc.)."""
```

##### Enhanced Result Display
```python
# Modified result_display.py
class ResultDisplayComponent:
    def _render_result_item(self, result: Dict, idx: int, allow_selection: bool = True):
        """Enhanced result item with better selection feedback."""
        
        # Check if already selected using unique key
        is_already_selected = SelectionManager.is_selected(result)
        
        if allow_selection:
            # Show different UI for already-selected items
            if is_already_selected:
                col1, col2 = st.columns([0.1, 0.9])
                with col1:
                    st.success("✓")  # Visual indicator
                with col2:
                    st.write(f"**{result['name']}** (Already Selected)")
                    if st.button(f"Remove from Selection", key=f"remove_{idx}"):
                        SelectionManager.remove_instrument(result)
                        st.rerun()
            else:
                # Standard selection checkbox
                selected = st.checkbox(
                    f"Select {result['name']}", 
                    key=f"select_{idx}",
                    help="Add to your instrument portfolio"
                )
                if selected:
                    SelectionManager.add_instrument(result, st.session_state.get('last_search_query', ''))
                    st.rerun()
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. Unique Instrument Identification
```python
def get_instrument_key(instrument: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Generate unique key for instrument deduplication."""
    # Use business key as recommended in CSV analysis
    exchange = (instrument.get('exchange') or '').upper()
    ticker = (instrument.get('ticker') or '').upper()
    contract_code = (instrument.get('contract_code') or '').upper()
    
    if exchange and ticker and contract_code:
        return f"{exchange}|{ticker}|{contract_code}"
    
    # Fallback to legacy key
    instrument_id = instrument.get('instrument_id', '')
    name = (instrument.get('name') or '').upper()
    return f"LEGACY|{instrument_id}|{name}"
```

#### 2. Selection Metadata Structure
```python
selection_metadata = {
    "instrument_key": "JSE|AAPL|EQU.US.AAPL",
    "selected_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "source_query": "Apple stock",
    "selection_session": "session_20240115_103000_abc123",
    "wallet_context": "USD",
    "user_notes": ""  # Optional user notes per selection
}
```

#### 3. State Persistence Strategy
```python
def persist_selections_to_browser():
    """Optional: Backup selections to browser localStorage."""
    selections = st.session_state.get('selected_instruments', [])
    selection_data = {
        'selections': selections,
        'metadata': st.session_state.get('selection_metadata', {}),
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'user_id': st.session_state.get('user_id', ''),
        'session_id': st.session_state.get('session_id', '')
    }
    # Use streamlit-js-eval or similar to store in localStorage
    st_js_eval(f"localStorage.setItem('instrument_selections', '{json.dumps(selection_data)}')")

def restore_selections_from_browser():
    """Optional: Restore selections from browser localStorage."""
    # Retrieve and validate stored selections
    pass
```

### User Experience Flow

   - **Monitoring**: Track selection count distribution

2. **State Corruption**
   - **Risk**: Invalid data in selection state
   - **Mitigation**: Implement validation and sanitization
   - **Recovery**: Graceful degradation with error logging

3. **Performance Impact**
   - **Risk**: Large selection lists slow down UI
   - **Mitigation**: Virtualized rendering for large lists
   - **Optimization**: Lazy loading of selection metadata

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: localStorage not available in all environments
   - **Mitigation**: Graceful fallback to session-only storage
   - **Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility validation

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- SelectionManager methods (add, remove, clear, validate)
- Instrument key generation and deduplication
- State persistence and recovery functions

#### Integration Tests
- End-to-end selection workflow
- Cross-page navigation with selections
- Search and selection interaction

#### User Acceptance Tests
- Multi-search selection scenarios
