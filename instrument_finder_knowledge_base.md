## Search Strategies & Best Practices

### For Best Search Results
1. **Use specific instrument names**: "Apple Inc" instead of just "Apple"
2. **Try ticker symbols**: "AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "TSLA"
3. **Use ISIN codes for exact matches**: e.g., "US0378331005" for Apple Inc
4. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with company name, then use ticker if needed
5. **Adjust fuzzy match threshold**: Lower values (60-70) for more results, higher (80-90) for precise matches

### Search Field Types
- **Company Names**: "Microsoft Corporation", "Tesla Inc", "Naspers Limited"
- **Ticker Symbols**: "MSFT", "TSLA", "NPN" (most reliable for exact matches)
- **ISIN Codes**: International Securities Identification Numbers (most precise)
- **Partial Names**: Will find multiple matches with similar names

### Search Options Explanation
- **Fuzzy Match Threshold**: Controls how closely the search term must match
  - 60-70: Very broad matching, more results, may include unrelated instruments
  - 80-85: Recommended setting, good balance of accuracy and coverage
  - 90-100: Very strict matching, fewer results, mostly exact matches
- **Maximum Results**: Limits the number of search results displayed (10-100)
- **Search Modes**:
  - **Smart (Recommended)**: Uses all search strategies for comprehensive results
  - **Exact Only**: Only shows perfect matches (fastest, most precise)
  - **Fuzzy Only**: Uses similarity matching (good for misspelled or partial names)

## Common Search Issues & Solutions

### "No results found"
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- Try broader search terms (remove "Inc", "Ltd", "Corporation")
- Lower the fuzzy match threshold (try 70 instead of 80)
- Check spelling of instrument name
- Try the ticker symbol instead of full name
- Change wallet context - instrument might only be available in specific wallets

### "Too many irrelevant results"
**Solutions:**
- Use more specific search terms
- Increase the fuzzy match threshold to 85-90
- Use ticker symbols for exact matches
- Try "Exact Only" search mode

### "Can't find a specific instrument I know exists"
**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify the exact spelling and try again
2. Search using the ticker symbol only
3. Try different wallet contexts (ZAR, USD, etc.)
4. Check if the instrument might be listed under a different name
5. Try partial name matching with lower fuzzy threshold

### "Instruments showing as available in wrong wallet"
**Explanation:**
- Instrument availability is determined by the `accountFiltersArray` data
- Some instruments may be available in multiple wallet types
- Regulatory restrictions may limit certain instruments to specific account types
- Double-check the wallet selection matches your intended investment account
